# Woody's Automotive Application Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains all the materials related to the Woody's Automotive Application Project, developed as part of CS 631 - Data Management System Design. This project's aim was to create a fully functional application for managing the registration and maintenance of customers and provisioning of online services in an automotive context.

## Learning Outcomes

### Database Management and SQL Proficiency
- **Advanced SQL Techniques:** Developed a deeper understanding of SQL through the creation and management of complex database structures including tables for customers, vehicles, invoices, and service appointments.
- **Database Schema Design:** Gained practical experience in designing a normalized relational database schema using MySQL Workbench to ensure data integrity and efficiency.

### Integration of Frontend and Backend
- **Full-Stack Development:** Implemented a full-stack application using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, which improved my understanding of how different layers of web development interact.
- **API Development:** Learned to create and manage RESTful APIs to connect the React frontend with a MySQL database, enhancing my skills in server-side logic.

### Problem Solving in Software Development
- **Debugging and Troubleshooting:** Addressed integration issues between frontend and backend components, such as data type mismatches in API path variables and foreign key constraints in the database.
- **Data Integrity and Operations:** Tackled challenges related to data deletion and manipulation within the context of foreign key constraints, enhancing my ability to manage relational databases effectively.

### User Interface and User Experience Design
- **Frontend Development:** Developed a user-friendly interface for customer registration and service appointment scheduling, which taught me valuable lessons about user-centric design and frontend programming.
- **Interactive Features Implementation:** Implemented dynamic features like service scheduling and management, which provided hands-on experience with React's state management and component lifecycle.

### Administrative and Reporting Tools
- **Administrative Features:** Built admin functionalities that allow management to modify service prices and view reports, which helped me understand the needs of different user roles within a software system.
- **Reporting:** Implemented SQL queries to generate reports such as pending service appointments and revenue calculations, advancing my skills in data retrieval and reporting.

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Development Tools:** Visual Studio Code, MySQL Workbench

## Conclusion
This project was invaluable for understanding the real-world applications of database management systems in business settings. It provided comprehensive exposure to the design, implementation, and management of a full-stack application, emphasizing the importance of integrating frontend and backend technologies with a robust database system.
